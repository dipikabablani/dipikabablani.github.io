Hello, I'm Deepika, and I use this space mostly for blogging. Please check out my blog posts if you want to read about things I'm most excited about right now.

Note: The creator of this website goes into hibernation in the second half of December. If you stop by around this time, you might notice that the website is down for maintenance. Please come back after the holidays!
